# FlashTrack

FlashTrack is a mobile application designed to help track and monitor flashback experiences as part of a PhD research project in Psychology. The app provides a simple and user-friendly way for participants to log their flashback experiences at regular intervals throughout the day.

## Features

- **Daily Check-ins**: Three scheduled check-in times per day:
  - Morning: 6:00 AM
  - Afternoon: 12:00 PM
  - Evening: 6:00 PM
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators show which check-ins have been completed for the day
- **Privacy Focused**: 
  - Minimal data collection (only device ID, flashback count, and timestamps)
  - Option to delete all data at any time
  - Data anonymization
  - No third-party sharing

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
